# Spatial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling in airway mucus

These scripts were used to study the spatial distribution of drugs in airway mucus and the spatial antimicrobial pharmacodynamics using spatial modeling.

### Scripts

The folder scripts contains the following files:
  
-   **01 diffusion_Radius.R**, contains the calculation of diffusion coefficients using modified Stokes-Einstein equation.
-   **02 tutorial.R**, uses small molecules as an example to showcase the spatial pharmacokinetics in the airway mucus (Fig.2)
-   **03 impact factor.R**, identifies the influential factors of the spatial PK from molecule/particle size (radius, r), mucin binding affinity, and half-lives, and under systems with different mucin concentration and muco-ciliary clearance (Fig.3, Fig.S2)
-   **04 impact dosing.R**, investigates the impact of infusion duration and frequency on drug spatial PK in mucus (Fig.4)
-   **05 spatialPD.R**, investigates the impact of drug distribution on drug efficacy using imipenem as a case study (Fig.5, Fig.S3).
-   **06 thin source.R**, compares the spatial pharmacokinetics with thin source and infinite source (Fig.S5).

### Functions

Above scripts depend on certain functions written in separate files.

-   **pde.R**, contains the discretized partial differential equations for describing the spatial pharmacokinetics in airway mucus.
-   **pde_pkpd_emax.R**, contains the discretized partial differential equations for describing the spatial pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in airway mucus.
